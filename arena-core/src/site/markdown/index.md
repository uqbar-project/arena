 
# Introduction


**Arena is a MVVM UI framework** that strongly encourages the separation between model and ui classes, although
based on automatic bidirectional bindings and small *single-responsability* reusable controllers.
Through this it clearly shapes the core concepts of object design applied to UI-development.

It also implements a transparent AOP-based mechanism for object-level transactions and observability (object properties). 

This makes extremely easy the developer tasks in order to bind UI components with domain, by reducing repeatable domain code such as triggering events or handling transactions.

Arena is being used since 2010 in several argentinean public universities in order to teach the core concepts of object-oriented user interfaces.
