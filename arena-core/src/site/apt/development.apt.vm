Developing Arena
 
 Arena is currently being developed in {{{http://www.scala-lang.org/}Scala Language}}. Here a list of requirements in order to setup a working 
 environment to start working in Arena development (note that these are not instructions to "use" Arena, but to extend it of change it)


Requirements
 
   * Java Development Kit 1.8 
   
   * Scala 2.11 (2.11.8 is fine)

 <<Note:>> We are currently working on it, but we still don't have a C.I. 
 in order to deploy new versions of artifacts every time someone pushes a change to master. 
 So, this means that, every time you push something, you'll also need to 
 manually deploy it with "mvn deploy". This also means that, probably, for now, 
 if you want to have it all working straight right after checkout, then, 
 go ahead and check out ALL projects listed below, instead of just picking some of them.

Checkout Projects/Repos

 It's useful to create a folder to hold all the repos (projects), but well, optional:

+--
mkdir arena
cd arena
+--

 The main repository is {{{https://github.com/uqbar-project/arena}here}}
 
 
Main Arena Projects

 * <<arena-core>>: contains all the components and Arena API for arena users. Although it doesn't have any implementation, so you need to use an implementation for this. Currently we only have one: arena-jface.

 * <<arena-jface>>: Implementation of Arena on top of SWT, JFace, and JFace Databindings.
 
 * <<arena-examples>>: Contains some examples small apps for internal manual testing.
 
 []

 In order to check them out:

+--
git clone https://github.com/uqbar-project/arena
+--
 
* Additional Utilities

 * <<uqbar-domain>>: Utility to model domains. Allows to annotate objects as @Observables. Also contains some API for persistence without coupling it to any implementation.
 
 * <<arena-xtend>>: Extensions to use arena with xtend. Provides kind of an internal DSL for building bindings easily and in a declarative way.
   Xtend 2.11+ is required (tested with Xtend 2.12)

 []
  
 Check-out:
 
+--
git clone https://github.com/uqbar-project/uqbar-domain
+--  

 arena-xtend is in https://github.com/uqbar-project/arena repository.
 
 
* Components for Observability / Transactional Aspects
 <<(not needed unless you'll change this foundations)>>
 
 If you'll work on the transactional or observability aspects behind Arena, you must download the following projects:

 * <<apo-apo>> (Aspects for Pure Objects): Small AOP framework on top of Javassist. It creates a more abstract general layer on top of javassist in order to express all AOP concepts: pointcuts, join-points, aspects, etc.

 * <<apo-poo>> (Pure Observable Objects): implements transparent objects observability over AOP. Based on apo-core.

 * <<apo-pot>> (Pure Objects Transactions): Implements a transparent transactions mechanism for objects through AOP. (Transactional objects).

 * <<apo-parent>>: Additional configuration for apo-core, apo-poo, apo-pot
 
 []
 
 
 In addition you can checkout some parent projects if you need to change them:

+--
git clone https://github.com/uqbar-project/uqbar-parent-project
git clone https://github.com/uqbar-project/uqbar-scala-parent
+--
  
IDE
 
 As we use maven, you can use whatever IDE you want. Although, we can suggest some proven Environment:

 * Eclipse Neon with ScalaIDE 
 
 * IntelliJIDEA with Scala plugin
 
 []

 The proven environment is based on Eclipse Neon version. Here's a sample environment
 
* Based on Eclipse

 * Install Eclipse Neon (4.6.3 is fine)

 * <<Scalaide>>
 
  * Install ScalaIde for Scala 2.11.x from the following update site: http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/lithium/e46/scala211/stable/site
 
  * Install m2e-scala from update site: http://alchim31.free.fr/m2e-scala/update-site

Maven configuration

 You need to <<configure your maven settings>> in order to connect to Uqbar's repositories, both to retrieve artifacts, but also to deploy new versions:

 File ~/.m2/settings.xml (if .m2 folder is not already created, then create it)
 
+--
#!xml

 <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
