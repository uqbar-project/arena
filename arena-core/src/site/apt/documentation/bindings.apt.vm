Binding in Arena

 In Arena you can define a two-way <<binding>> mechanism between a UI component and a model property. 
 This is accomplished by default <<binder>> objects that can be used or extend.        

 <<Note:>> All classes are in package org.uqbar.arena.bindings (from arena-core component)
     
 Here are different types of bindings explained:
      
 * {{{./bindings/binders.html}Binders}} 
 
 * {{{./bindings/transformers.html}Value Transformers}} (for textboxes)
 
 * {{{./bindings/filters.html}Filters}} (for textboxes)
 
 * {{{./bindings/adapters.html}Adapters}} (for selectors, columns in tables and other UI component collection-related)
