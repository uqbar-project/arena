Navigation

 Navigation in Arena is very simple: you instantiate a Panel and then you open it. Panel can be a subclass of <<Window>> or <<Dialog>>. 
 
 Suppose you are in a Search Window with a "New" button. What should this button do?   
 
+--
// Xtend
new CreateCustomerDialog(this).open

// Java
new CreateCustomerDialog(this).open();
+--
 
* Navigation back

 Dialogs offer a way to define behavior once they are closed. This can be done <<before they are opened>>:
 
+--
// Xtend
val dialog = new SomeKindOfDialog(this, modelObjectForSomeKindOfDialog)
dialog.onAccept [ | modelObject.search ]   
dialog.open

// Java
SomeKindOfDialog dialog = new SomeKindOfDialog(this, modelObjectForSomeKindOfDialog);
dialog.onAccept(getModelObject()::search);
dialog.open();
+--    

 In the above example we instantiate the dialog, and before we open it we define that as soon as the dialog is closed we should trigger a search the model object in the parent view.
 

* Passing data to another view

 As windows are objects, we can use two well known mechanisms to pass data between two views:
 
 * sending objects in the constructor
 
 * assigning a reference in a setter method

+--
public void editCustomer() {
   this.openDialog(new EditCustomerWindow(this, this.getModelObject().getCustomerSelected()));
}
+--
